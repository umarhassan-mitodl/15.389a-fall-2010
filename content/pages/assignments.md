The case write-up should be no more than three double-spaced pages (750 words). You may choose any case to analyze.

A write-up is an analytical discussion of issues central to the case. Please do not summarize the case or repeat case facts except to bolster your argument. Based on the information provided in the case materials, please be analytically critical and evaluative. You should propose alternate managerial views and action plans whenever appropriate and discuss the relevance and applicability of the frameworks proposed in the readings and lectures. In short, you should write what you think of the situation in the case and not merely what the author of the case says.

Note that some cases include study questions or write-up questions at the end of the text; others have questions available below. These are study guidelines, not writing requirements. It is far more valuable to write a cogent analysis than to mechanically answer every question.

## Case Questions

### "Singapore Inc."

1. How do you assess Singapore's economic performance since 1957? How do you characterize the development strategy of Singapore during this take-off period?
2. Evaluate its performance in terms of GDP growth and productivity growth.
3. How have the business-government relations contributed to that performance?
4. How do you assess the new direction of its strategy? Can a government jump-start entrepreneurship?

### "India's Intellectual Property Rights Regime and the Pharmaceutical Industry"

1. What is piracy? Did Indian firms pirate the intellectual property rights of Western pharmaceutical firms after 1970? Why were Indian firms successful in this business space?
2. Should a country protect its own pharmaceutical industry? How do you measure the successes and the failures of such protection? What are the conditions that may make such protection more successful? Should India now move away from its 1970 IPR regime? What are the pros and cons?
3. Does the experience of India's pharmaceutical industry offer valuable lessons for China? What are the lessons for MNCs?

### "Indonesia: Attracting Foreign Investment"

1. Assess the overall role of FDI in promoting economic growth in Indonesia.
2. Assess the conflicts or complementarities between foreign investors and local interests in the case of Indonesia.
3. Does FDI promote or hinder the development of local entrepreneurship?
